# Build a Responsive Website - HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox & More - project

In this project, I learned how to:

- import and use fonts from other sources in the style file
- define variables in CSS
- use display: grid, display: flex and their options and settings.

I followed the tutorial from [Traversy Media's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4).

Thanks to Traversy Media.
